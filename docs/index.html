Its reputation for a light government hand combined with the natural beauty, clean air, ample water and rural lifestyle has attracted many newcomers in 2020 and 2021 - along with developers.</span> <br><br> </div> <div id="e2" class="rightScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">2</div> <span class="scrollingBody">This is a mostly rural county, which the U.S. Government defines as anything outside a metro area of 50,000 or more people, or outside a settlement of more than 2,500 people. But "rural" also describes a landscape characterized by low density, agricultural and timber working lands, which is North Idaho's heritage.</span> </div> <div id="e3" class="rightScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">3</div> <span class="scrollingBody">In 2006, Bonner County updated its Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Map with robust public involvement. The plan reflects how residents want to see the county grow. One of the stated goals of the plan is to "encourage the community to grow while retaining its rural character and protecting its unique natural resources." The Land Use Map set aside much of the county outside of the towns as Agricultural/Forest areas in response to public comment that called for protecting that working land heritage and rural quality of life. The Ag/Forest designation requires that land parcels are no less than 10 acres in size.</span> <br><br> <div class="scrollingLegendItem"> <span class="right">Rural Residential Zoning Districts <div class="mapLegendBox right" style="background-color:#fdf149"></div><br> <span class="right">Agriculture/Forestry Zoning Districts <div class="mapLegendBox right" style="background-color:#df49fd"></div><br> <span class="right">Higher Density Land Uses <div class="mapLegendBox right" style="background-color:#509f9b"></div><br> </span></span></span></div><br> </div> <div id="e3b" class="leftScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">4</div> <span class="scrollingBody"> Zoning codes are the laws that govern land use. Zoning - which determines type of land use and density of development - should be consistent with the county Land Use Map. Applications for zoning changes have dramatically increased with the booming real estate market. Nearly all changes have resulted in higher density - so more houses can be squeezed onto the landscape. </span> </div> <div id="e4" class="leftScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">4</div> <span class="scrollingBody"> From January 2019 to November 2021, 53 zoning changes were approved by the Bonner County Commissioners, affecting more than 2,800 acres. In some cases, the commissioners had to also amend the Land Use Plan to accommodate the higher density.</span> <br><br> <div class="scrollingLegendItem"> <span class="right">Sections where zoning changes have occured since 2019 <div class="mapLegendBox right" style="background-color:#2708d9"></div><br> </span></div> </div> <div id="e5" class="rightScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">5</div> <span class="scrollingBody">While zoning changes don't always immediately result in development, the rationale for most of the zoning changes has been to divide the property for housing. Here are parcels in the county which have a residential structure</span> <br><br> </div> <div id="e6" class="rightScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">6</div> <span class="scrollingBody">In 2016, the County Commissioners made it much easier to divide land. Land divisions up to 4 lots were exempted from subdivision design standards (which provide assurance to buyers that critical services are provided while protecting natural resources) and could now be approved by the county planning director with no public notice or input. Also, any land divisions up to 11 lots were exempt from public hearings.</span> <br><br> <div> <img class="scrollingImage" src="parcelGrowth.c19a1519.jpg"> <div class="imageCredit">Bonner County Assessor's Office</div> </div> <div class="scrollingLegendItem"> <span class="right">Parcel divisions since 2016 <div class="mapLegendBox right" style="border-style:solid;border-color:#ff4242;"></div> </span></div> </div> <div id="e6a" class="rightScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">5</div> <span class="scrollingBody">In spring of 2020, Bonner County changed the land use map in two sections of the Hoodoo Valley, covering 1,200 acres, from 10 and 20-acre lots to 5-acre residential lots. Soon after, a developer used the new administrative "Minor Land Division" process to subdivide 360 acres into 72 lots without any public knowledge or input. The development is a gated community called Clagstone Ranch.</span> <div class="scrollingLegendItem"> <span class="right">Rezoned sections<div class="mapLegendBox right" style="border-style:solid;border-color:#f1ff00;"></div> </span></div> <div> <img class="scrollingImage" src="SatchelDriveB&W.c57841c8.jpg"> <div class="imageCredit"></div> </div> </div> <div id="e6b" class="rightScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">6</div> <span class="scrollingBody">Here you can see the new parcel divisions since this change occured.</span> </div> <div id="e7a" class="leftScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">7</div> <span class="scrollingBody">In his defense of supporting ongoing upzoning around the county, one county commissioner has argued that 5-acre parcels are consistent with retaining the county's rural character and that the land use map change in 2008 was arbitrary. Here the dots show parcels with residential structures.</span> <br><br> </div> <div id="e7b" class="leftScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">7</div> <span class="scrollingBody"> This shows what build-out would look like if all private land along county roads were divided into 5-acre parcels.</span> <br><br> </div> <div id="e8" class="leftScrollBox scrollingTextBox"> <div class="slideNum">8</div> <span class="scrollingBody">One rationale for approving zoning changes has been that the adjacent parcels are at a higher density.
